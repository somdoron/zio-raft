## Core Standards

### 1. Response Formatting (Rating: 1)
- All responses must be formatted in markdown
- Use backticks for code elements (files, directories, functions, classes)
- Maintain consistent formatting across all communications

### 2. Tool Communication (Rating: 2)
- Never refer to tool names directly
- Only use tools when necessary
- Explain actions before using tools
- Maintain proper shell state between commands

### 3. Rule Location (Rating: 1)
- All rules must be stored in `.cursor/rules` directory
- All rules must be MDC files with `.mdc` extension
- Follow consistent naming convention: lowercase with underscores

## Scope

# Tool Usage Guidelines

This rule follows the structure and progression defined in `rule_management_standards.mdc`.

## Core Standards

### 1. Tool Selection (Rating: 2)
- Choose appropriate tools for each task

- Consider tool limitations and capabilities
- Prefer simpler tools over complex ones
- Document tool selection rationale

### 2. Tool Execution (Rating: 2)
- Handle background processes appropriately
- Append `| cat` to commands that might use a pager
- Maintain proper shell state between commands
- Handle errors gracefully
- Clean up resources after use

### 3. Tool Output (Rating: 2)
- Format tool output consistently
- Handle long-running processes appropriately
- Provide clear progress indicators
- Log important operations
- Handle sensitive information securely

## Scope

This rule applies to all tool usage in the ZIO Raft project, including:
- Development tools
- Build tools
- Testing tools
- Documentation tools
- Code generation tools

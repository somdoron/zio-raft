# Documentation and Comments

This rule follows the structure and progression defined in `rule_management_standards.mdc`.

## Core Standards

### 1. Comment Guidelines (Rating: 2)
- Add comments only for non-trivial code
- For generated code with trivial comments:
  - Include initial comments for code understanding
  - Ask user if comments should be removed after review
  - Remove comments upon user confirmation
- Avoid redundant comments
- Use clear and concise language

### 2. Documentation Standards (Rating: 3)
- Document public APIs thoroughly
- Include parameter and return type documentation
- Explain complex algorithms or business logic
- Provide examples for non-obvious usage
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

### 3. Generated Code Comments (Rating: 2)
- Add explanatory comments for generated code
- Mark generated code sections clearly
- Include references to source templates
- Document any assumptions or limitations
- Remove temporary comments after review

## Scope

This rule applies to all documentation and comments in the ZIO Raft project, including:
- Core Raft implementation
- Storage implementations
- Tests and test utilities
- Build configuration
- Documentation
- Generated code

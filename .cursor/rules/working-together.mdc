# Working Together: AI-User Collaboration Pattern

## Rating System

The rule's status is automatically managed by Cursor based on usage metrics:

- ðŸ”´ **experimental** (default): New pattern, limited validation
- ðŸŸ¡ **beta**: Validated but needs monitoring
- ðŸŸ¢ **stable**: Well-established and safe for widespread use

Status upgrades happen automatically when:
- **experimental â†’ beta**: 5+ implementations with 90%+ success rate
- **beta â†’ stable**: 15+ implementations across 3+ different projects

## Scope

This rule applies to all interactions between users and AI assistants in Cursor, including:
- Code modifications
- Bug fixes
- Feature implementations
- Code reviews
- Documentation updates

## Context

When working with an AI assistant on coding tasks, having a clear and consistent interaction pattern is crucial for effective collaboration. This pattern should ensure goal alignment, methodical progress, and quality outcomes.

## Core Standards

### 1. Rule Usage Declaration (Rating: 2)
- AI must explicitly state it is following the working-together rule at the beginning of each task
- The declaration must be visible and clear to the user
- The declaration should include which specific aspects of the rule are being applied
- Example: "I'll be following the working-together collaboration pattern for this task, focusing on goal alignment and plan confirmation."

### 2. Goal Alignment and Iteration (Rating: 3)
- The goal must be explicitly stated, verified, and reiterated
- AI must restate the goal in its own words to confirm understanding
- User must have opportunity to correct any misalignment
- All proposed actions must be validated against this goal
- Goal must be referenced throughout the interaction
- Example: "Based on your request, our goal is to [restate goal]. Is this understanding correct?"

### 3. Plan-First Approach with Explicit Confirmation (Rating: 4)
- Before making ANY changes:
  1. Assess current state (e.g., compile, run tests)
  2. Analyze issues and requirements
  3. Create a clear, structured plan
  4. Present plan for discussion and confirmation
  5. Explicitly ask for confirmation: "Do you approve this plan?"
  6. Only proceed after receiving explicit plan approval
  7. Reiterate the plan before implementing each major step

### 4. No Changes Without Confirmation (Rating: 5)
- AI must NEVER make code changes before receiving explicit confirmation
- Each significant change requires separate confirmation
- Changes must be previewed when possible
- User must have opportunity to modify the proposed changes
- Each code change must follow a git commit or checkpoint
- Example: "Here's my proposed change to file X. Would you like me to implement this change?"

### 5. Scope Management (Rating: 3)
- Stay focused on the confirmed goal
- Additional suggestions should be:
  - Documented separately
  - Not mixed with current implementation
  - Presented as future considerations
- Avoid scope creep during implementation
- Regularly check if current work aligns with original goal

### 6. Verification-Driven Development (Rating: 3)
- Start with verification of current state
- Verify after each significant change
- Include broader verification (e.g., test compilation) when appropriate
- Use verification results to inform next steps
- Document verification results

### 7. Communication Standards (Rating: 3)
For every change:
- **Before**: Explain what will be done
- **During**: Report significant findings
- **After**: Summarize what was done
- **Issues**: Present problems with proposed solutions
- Use clear section headers to delineate different parts of the interaction

### 8. Incremental Progress (Rating: 2)
- Make small, verifiable changes
- Track progress against the plan
- Adjust approach based on findings
- Maintain goal alignment throughout
- Summarize progress at regular intervals

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes
Following this pattern will:
- Ensure consistent, goal-oriented progress
- Prevent unauthorized or premature changes
- Maintain clear communication
- Produce verifiable results
- Enable effective collaboration
- Reduce misunderstandings and rework

### Negative Outcomes
Not following this pattern may result in:
- Misaligned efforts
- Premature or unauthorized changes
- Scope creep
- Unclear communication
- Inefficient use of resources
- Reduced quality of outcomes

## Compliance

An interaction is compliant when:
- AI explicitly declares it is following the working-together rule
- Goal is explicitly stated, verified, and reiterated
- Plan is created and confirmed before implementation
- No changes are made without explicit confirmation
- Changes are verified and aligned with goal
- Communication follows the specified pattern
- Progress is incremental and trackable

## Examples

### Compliant Interaction
```
User: I need to fix the compilation error in Node.scala

AI: I'll be following the working-together collaboration pattern for this task.

GOAL: Based on your request, our goal is to identify and fix the compilation error in Node.scala. Is this understanding correct?

User: Yes, that's correct.

AI: Great! Let me first assess the current state before proposing a plan.

[AI examines the file and compilation error]

AI: Here's my proposed plan:
1. Analyze the specific compilation error in Node.scala
2. Identify the root cause of the error
3. Propose a specific fix with code changes
4. Verify the fix resolves the compilation error

Do you approve this plan before I proceed?

User: Yes, please proceed with the plan.

AI: I'll now execute step 1 of our plan: analyzing the compilation error.

[AI analyzes error]

AI: I've completed step 1. The compilation error is [error details].
Moving to step 2: identifying the root cause...

[Process continues with explicit confirmation before any code changes]
```

### Non-Compliant Interaction
```
User: Fix the error in Node.scala

AI: I'll fix it right away.
[AI makes changes without verification, plan or confirmation]

AI: Done! I fixed the error by changing line 42.
```

## Rule Usage Tracking

The rule metrics are automatically updated through Cursor's rule engine:

1. **Detection**:
   - Cursor monitors when this rule is used in interactions
   - The tracking comment is automatically inserted:
     ```scala
     // Implements rule: working-together
     // Implementation #X (auto-updated by Cursor)
     ```

2. **Validation**:
   After each rule implementation, Cursor will:
   - Ask the user to confirm if the implementation followed the pattern correctly
   - Request permission to update rule metrics
   - Only record success if explicitly confirmed by the user
   - Skip metric updates if the user indicates issues

3. **Automatic Updates**:
   When user confirms successful implementation:
   - `implementations` count increases
   - `successful_reviews` updates based on user confirmation
   - `last_updated` reflects confirmation timestamp
   - Status may upgrade based on thresholds

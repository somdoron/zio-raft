- **Includes**:
  - CloseSession vs ConnectionClosed distinction
  - Message direction reference
  - State transition details
  - Recovery scenarios
- **Use When**: Adding new messages or modifying protocol behavior
- **Impact**: Ensures semantic precision and prevents misuse

---

### 3. **Quick Start Guide** (docs/)

#### `QUICK_START_FOR_AI.md` ⭐ START HERE
- **What**: Fast onboarding guide for AI agents
- **Includes**:
  - Critical patterns checklist
  - Common issues and solutions
  - Message quick reference
  - PR #15 lessons learned
- **Use When**: Starting ANY new task on ZIO Raft
- **Impact**: Reduces ramp-up time, prevents known mistakes

## 📋 Recommended Reading Order for Next Task

### Phase 1: Quick Orientation (5 min)
1. **Start**: `docs/QUICK_START_FOR_AI.md`
   - Skim "Critical Patterns"
   - Review "Common Issues"

### Phase 2: Deep Dive (15 min)
2. **If working on sessions**: `docs/architecture/session-lifecycle.md`
3. **If adding messages**: `docs/architecture/message-semantics.md`
4. **If implementing state machines**: `.cursor/rules/stream-architecture-pattern.mdc`

### Phase 3: During Implementation
5. **Reference**: Quick reference tables in docs
6. **Validate**: Checklists in each rule file
7. **Compare**: Look at RaftServer/RaftClient for similar patterns

## 🎯 What Each Resource Prevents

| Resource | Prevents | Based On |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **`avoid-premature-abstraction.mdc`** ⭐ | **Creating 15 files, deleting 7 later** | **PR #15 "simplify" commits** |
| `stream-architecture-pattern.mdc` | Bypassing event stream | PR #15 confirmSession feedback |
| `distributed-resource-cleanup.mdc` | Resource leaks | ContinueSession old routing cleanup |
| `zio-purity-over-stdlib.mdc` | Impure operations | "remove usage of instant.now" commit |
| `session-lifecycle.md` | Session state confusion | Multiple iterations on semantics |
| `message-semantics.md` | Message misuse | ConnectionClosed direction mistake |
| `QUICK_START_FOR_AI.md` | Repeated mistakes | All of the above |

## 🔄 When to Update These Resources

### Update Triggers:

1. **New architectural pattern emerges**
   → Add to relevant rule or create new rule

2. **Common mistake made multiple times**
   → Add to "Common Pitfalls" in relevant doc

3. **Reviewer feedback reveals insight**
   → Document the insight in architecture docs

4. **Implementation complexity requires explanation**
   → Create architecture documentation

5. **New similar component created**
   → Update usage tracking in rules

## 📈 Expected Impact

### Before These Resources:
- ❌ **Over-engineering with useless abstractions**
- ❌ Repeated mistakes (Instant.now(), bypassing streams)
- ❌ Incomplete resource cleanup
- ❌ Semantic confusion (CloseSession vs ConnectionClosed)
- ❌ Slow ramp-up for each new task

### After These Resources:
- ✅ AI agents start with correct patterns
- ✅ Fewer iterations needed to get architecture right
- ✅ Consistent implementation across features
- ✅ Faster development cycle

## 🎓 Key Learnings Captured

### From PR #15 Implementation:

1. **Stream Architecture**: Don't bypass the unified stream (7d0c0c5)
2. **Pure Effects**: Replace Instant.now() with Clock.instant (5b20867)
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Disconnect old routing before reconnecting (d6d64f3)
4. **Message Direction**: ConnectionClosed is Client→Server, not Server→Client
5. **Simplification**: Simpler is better (multiple "ai simplify" commits)

### Architectural Decisions:

- Unified stream pattern for both client and server
- Pure functional state machines (no mutable state)
- Multi-layer resource management (Transport + App + Cluster)
- Durable sessions with timeout-based expiration
- Leader-aware operation validation

## 🚦 Constitution Compliance Quick Check

Before submitting PR, verify:

- [ ] **Functional Purity**: All `Instant.now()` → `Clock.instant`?
- [ ] **Stream Architecture**: All state changes through stream?
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: All layers cleaned up?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: No `throw`, only `ZIO.fail`?
- [ ] **Existing Code**: No modifications to core Raft interfaces?
- [ ] **ZIO Consistency**: Using ZIO primitives (not Java alternatives)?
- [ ] **Tests**: Written before implementation (TDD)?

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You're ready to start when you can answer:

1. ✅ **Am I creating unnecessary traits/abstractions?** (Start simple!)
2. ✅ Does my change need to go through the unified stream?
3. ✅ What resources exist at what layers?
4. ✅ Am I using any impure Java stdlib operations?
5. ✅ What happens on reconnection/cleanup?
6. ✅ Are my message semantics clear and documented?

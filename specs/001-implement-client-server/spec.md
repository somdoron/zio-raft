## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a client application developer, I need to reliably interact with a Raft cluster to submit commands and read data, with the system automatically handling leader election, redirections, and ensuring strong consistency guarantees even during network partitions and server failures. I need durable sessions that survive leader changes and temporary disconnections, allowing me to seamlessly continue work without losing context. Additionally, I need the server to be able to initiate one-way requests to clients (such as dispatching work items from a queue) with reliable delivery and immediate acknowledgment, all while maintaining session continuity through keep-alive mechanisms.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a healthy Raft cluster with multiple nodes, **When** a client submits a write command to any node, **Then** the command should be successfully processed and the client should receive confirmation once the command is committed
2. **Given** a client submits a command to a follower node, **When** the follower is not the leader, **Then** the client should be redirected to the current leader or receive leader information
3. **Given** a Raft cluster undergoing leader election, **When** a client attempts to submit commands, **Then** the client should receive appropriate error responses and be able to retry once a new leader is established
4. **Given** a client wants to read data, **When** submitting a read request, **Then** the client should receive strongly consistent data that reflects all committed operations
5. **Given** network partitions or server failures, **When** a client submits operations, **Then** the system should maintain linearizability and provide clear feedback about operation status
6. **Given** a server needs to dispatch work to clients (e.g., queue items to workers), **When** the server initiates a request to a connected client, **Then** the client should receive the request reliably and immediately acknowledge receipt
7. **Given** multiple clients are connected and available for work, **When** the server has work to distribute, **Then** the server should be able to select appropriate clients and dispatch work efficiently
8. **Given** a client receives a server-initiated request, **When** the client gets the request, **Then** the client should immediately acknowledge receipt and process the work asynchronously
9. **Given** a client establishes a new session with the cluster, **When** connecting for the first time, **Then** the server should generate a unique durable session identifier that persists across leader changes and return it to the client
10. **Given** a client with an existing session experiences a temporary disconnection, **When** reconnecting to the cluster, **Then** the client should be able to continue its session using the session identifier without losing context
11. **Given** a healthy client-server connection, **When** the client sends keep-alive messages at regular intervals, **Then** the server should respond with acknowledgments to confirm connection health
12. **Given** a client stops sending keep-alive messages, **When** the server timeout period expires, **Then** the server should detect the disconnection and clean up associated resources
13. **Given** a client sends keep-alive messages but receives no response, **When** the client timeout period expires, **Then** the client should detect server disconnection and attempt reconnection with session continuation
14. **Given** a client attempts to continue a session that has been evicted or expired by the server, **When** providing the session identifier, **Then** the server should reject the session continuation request and require the client to create a new session
15. **Given** a client submits a request and doesn't receive a response within the timeout period, **When** the retry interval elapses, **Then** the client should resend the request with the same request identifier to ensure idempotency
16. **Given** a server sends a request to a client and the client acknowledges successfully, **When** the server resends the same request (due to missing acknowledgment), **Then** the client should detect the duplicate using the request identifier and send the cached acknowledgment without reprocessing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the current leader becomes unavailable during command processing?
- How does the system handle clients with stale leader information?
- What occurs when a client submits the same command multiple times (idempotency)?
- How are timeouts and retries managed for long-running operations?
- What feedback is provided when the cluster lacks quorum?
- What happens when a server initiates a request to a client that becomes disconnected?
- How does the server handle clients that don't acknowledge server-initiated requests within timeout?
- What occurs when a client receives duplicate server-initiated requests?
- How does the system handle server-initiated requests during leader transitions?
- What happens when a client tries to continue a session that has expired or been cleaned up?
- How does the system handle keep-alive messages during leader election periods?
- What occurs when a client reconnects with a session ID but to a different cluster member?
- How are unacknowledged server-initiated requests handled when a client session is temporarily disconnected?
- What happens when keep-alive timeouts differ between client and server configurations?
- How does the server ensure session ID uniqueness when generating identifiers for new sessions?
- What validation steps occur when a client attempts to continue a session with an expired or invalid session ID?
- How does the client handle retry logic when responses are delayed but eventually arrive?
- What happens when client retry intervals are shorter than server processing time?
- How does the client manage acknowledgment caching for server-initiated request idempotency?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Client Session**: Represents a durable client connection that persists across leader changes and disconnections, including session ID, capability information, connection state, keep-alive tracking, and pending request management
- **Session State**: Contains session metadata that is replicated across cluster members, including server-generated session ID, client capability definitions, creation time, last activity, expiration status, and pending server-initiated requests
- **Keep-Alive Message**: Heartbeat messages sent by clients to maintain connection health, including timestamps and session identifiers
- **Keep-Alive Response**: Server acknowledgments to client keep-alive messages, confirming connection health and providing cluster status updates
- **Client Request**: Encapsulates client commands with unique request identifiers, timestamps, session information, and retry metadata for deduplication and ordering
- **Server-Initiated Request**: Contains work dispatched from server to client, including unique request identifiers, task details, timeout information, response requirements, and session context
- **Client Response**: Provides results from client back to server for server-initiated requests, including request identifier, completion status, output data, and session information
- **Leader Redirect Response**: Contains current leader information and cluster topology for client connection management
- **Command Response**: Provides operation results, confirmation status, and any error information back to clients
- **Session Continuation Token**: Credentials used by clients to resume existing sessions after reconnection, containing the server-generated session ID and any required authentication information for session validation
- **Client Retry State**: Client-side tracking of pending requests, retry attempts, timeout configuration, and response correlation for reliable request delivery
- **Response Cache**: Client-side cache of responses to server-initiated requests, indexed by request identifier for idempotency detection and duplicate response handling
- **Cluster Configuration**: Maintains current cluster membership and leadership information accessible to clients

## Out of Scope

The following retry and idempotency mechanisms are explicitly **NOT** included in this feature specification as they are handled by the underlying Raft consensus algorithm and state machine:

- **Server-side retry logic**: Retrying of server-initiated requests to clients is managed by the Raft state machine
- **Server-side idempotency**: Deduplication of server operations and commands is handled by the Raft state machine
- **Inter-server communication reliability**: Raft protocol handles retry and idempotency for communication between cluster members

This feature focuses specifically on **client-side** retry and idempotency mechanisms for robust client-server interaction.
